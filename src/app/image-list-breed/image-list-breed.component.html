        <h1>What's a dog breed?</h1>

        <p>People have been breeding dogs since prehistoric times. The earliest dog breeders used wolves to create
            domestic dogs.
            From the beginning, humans purposefully bred dogs to perform various tasks. Hunting, guarding, and herding
            are thought
            to be among the earliest jobs eagerly performed by the animal destined to be called “man’s best friend.”</p>

        <p>For thousands of years, humans bred dogs toward the physical and mental traits best suited for the work
            expected of
            them. The sleek Greyhound types bred to chase fleet-footed prey, and the huge mastiff types used as guard
            dogs and
            warriors, are two ancient examples of dogs bred for specific jobs.</p>
